# Spritesheet Creation Guide

TODO: Add video

Transcription:
Creating spritesheets with Spritehandler is done through a panel in the toolshelf of the Image Editor.
The default key-bind toggle the toolshelf is 'N'. Alternatively you can click and drag the small arrow on the upper right.
After opening the Spritehandler panel, there are two methods for creating a spritesheet and a list of parameters for the resulting spritesheet.
The 'Spritesheet from Files' button will allow the selection of on disk images to create a spritehsheet. Images do not need to be the same size.
The 'Sheet from Render' toggle will cause Spritehandler to automatically create a spritesheet once an animation render is completed. Video output is not supported.
After creating a spritesheet, you can edit it without needing to re-select the files or re-render.
A full explanation of each menu item can be found in the [UI Content](ui_contents.md) page of the documentation.
For convenience, the addon also includes an image resizing function. Unlike the normal Blender image resize option, the Spritehandler resizer offers a selection of filters. Use the Nearest filter when working on pixel art.
